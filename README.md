Interrupt Handling: Real computers have mechanisms to handle interrupts, which are signals that indicate the occurrence of events that require immediate attention. Interrupts can be triggered by hardware devices, timers, or software exceptions. Adding an interrupt handling mechanism to the decimal computer would allow it to respond to external events and handle exceptional conditions.
Memory Management: The current implementation uses a simple main memory model with direct addressing. Real computers often have more sophisticated memory management systems, including virtual memory, memory protection, and memory segmentation. Implementing these features would enhance the memory management capabilities of the decimal computer.
Input/Output (I/O) Subsystem: The current code has a basic implementation of input and output devices. In real computers, the I/O subsystem is more complex and includes various peripheral devices, device drivers, and protocols for communication between the computer and external devices. Expanding the I/O subsystem would make the decimal computer more realistic and capable of interacting with a wider range of devices.
Pipelining and Parallelism: Modern computers often employ techniques like pipelining and parallelism to improve performance. Pipelining allows overlapping the execution of multiple instructions, while parallelism enables the simultaneous execution of multiple instructions or tasks. Incorporating these techniques into the decimal computer would enhance its performance and make it more representative of real-world computer architectures.
Error Handling and Exception Mechanisms: Real computers have robust error handling and exception mechanisms to detect and handle various types of errors, such as arithmetic exceptions, memory access violations, and invalid instructions. Implementing comprehensive error handling and exception mechanisms would make the decimal computer more resilient and capable of handling exceptional situations gracefully.
Assembly Language and Higher-Level Language Support: While the current code uses a simplified assembly-like language, real computers often support a standardized assembly language and provide compilers or interpreters for higher-level programming languages. Adding support for a well-defined assembly language and higher-level language compilers would make the decimal computer more usable and accessible to programmers.
System Software and Operating System: Real computers have system software, including an operating system, device drivers, and utility programs, that manage the computer's resources, provide services to applications, and facilitate user interaction. Developing a basic operating system and system software components would make the decimal computer more complete and functional.
