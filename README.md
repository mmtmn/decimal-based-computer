- Pipelining and Parallelism: Modern computers often employ techniques like pipelining and parallelism to improve performance. Pipelining allows overlapping the execution of multiple instructions, while parallelism enables the simultaneous execution of multiple instructions or tasks. Incorporating these techniques into the decimal computer would enhance its performance and make it more representative of real-world computer architectures.
- Error Handling and Exception Mechanisms: Real computers have robust error handling and exception mechanisms to detect and handle various types of errors, such as arithmetic exceptions, memory access violations, and invalid instructions. Implementing comprehensive error handling and exception mechanisms would make the decimal computer more resilient and capable of handling exceptional situations gracefully.
- Assembly Language and Higher-Level Language Support: While the current code uses a simplified assembly-like language, real computers often support a standardized assembly language and provide compilers or interpreters for higher-level programming languages. Adding support for a well-defined assembly language and higher-level language compilers would make the decimal computer more usable and accessible to programmers.
- System Software and Operating System: Real computers have system software, including an operating system, device drivers, and utility programs, that manage the computer's resources, provide services to applications, and facilitate user interaction. Developing a basic operating system and system software components would make the decimal computer more complete and functional.
